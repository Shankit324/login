Hi, I'm Shankit.This is my login page project on github.This project is mainly based on otp generation and sending it to user email id during registration of an unknown user using modified form of nodemailer feature.It contains a homepage and a signup page.After registration of an unknown user, a basic profie card of that user is updated in the website. All the user data is stored in backend database.
